There is a huge tea market near me, and I want some suggestions for spring tea to look for.\n\nI have several Chinese friends willing to come along to help bargain/make sure I don't get ripped off, but none of them know much about tea.  I don't have a budget limit, and love greens.  \n\nAny help is appreciated, thanks! ",
